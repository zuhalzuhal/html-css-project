                    <h3>FAHRENHEIT 451 by RAY BRADBURY</h3>
                    <p>
                        This novel presents a future American society where books are outlawed and 
                        "firemen" burn any that are found. The book's tagline explains the title:
                        "Fahrenheit 451 – the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and burns."

                    <h3>ANIMAL FARM by GEORGE ORWELL</h3>
                    <p>
                        The book tells the story of a group of farm animals 
                        who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create 
                        a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. 
                        Ultimately, however, the rebellion is betrayed and the farm
                        ends up in a state as bad as it was before, 
                        under the dictatorship of a pig named Napoleon.

                    <h3>THE LITTLE PRINCE by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</h3>
                    <p>
                        The story follows a young prince who visits various planets in space, including Earth, 
                        and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. 
                        Despite its style as a children's book, The Little Prince makes poignant 
                        observations about life and human nature.

                    <h3>THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY by OSCAR WILDE</h3>
                    <p>
                        Handsome, young, but morally corrupt Dorian Gray has his portrait made. 
                        As the years pass, he does not age, but evidence of his sins are apparent 
                        in his portrait,
                        which grows uglier with each transgression. 
                        He keeps it safely hidden in the attic.

                    <h3>THE LORD OF THE RINGS by J.R.R. TOLKIEN</h3>
                    <p>
                        The title of the novel refers to  the Dark Lord Sauron, who had in an earlier age 
                        created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign 
                         to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, 
                         a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, 
                         following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters.
