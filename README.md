# HTML/CSS Project

First step is to fork this repo into your own Github account - if you don't remember how, then refer back Lesson 0 contents.

## For Week 1

Create a new webpage on a subject that you're interested in (maybe the same topic you used for your Codepen submission). The page should **NOT** use any framework like Bootstrap and it should include the following elements:
  - The `.html` page and a linked `.css` file applies a consistent color scheme to links and text on your page.
  - A page header with a title and description for the site.
  - An articles section with three articles, each including a title, summary and a link.
  - Proper use of the semantic HTML tags we discussed.
  - Research the `:first-child` pseudo-class and use it to style the first article so that it stands out from the others.
  - Use this website [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) to generate random blocks of contents to fill your website.
  - **Commit often (with good meaningful commit messages), and Push to Github regularly.**
  - Make your website look as close as possible as this layout (there are things we didn't cover yet, such as layout of the right and left side, but consider that an optional challenge if you want one)

  </a>
  
  
  ## For Week 2

Revisit the webpage you created in last week's homework assignment. Add a sidebar to your site and move the site description into it. This should appear below the articles on small screens, then switch to a two-column layout with the articles and sidebar sitting side-by-side. Add at least three more articles and then convert them to a grid, so that you show 3 articles per row in a box layout.

- Research mobile-first, how would your HTML/CSS have been different if you followed a mobile-first approach?

  ## For Week 3
  - Explore how we name our classes and elements
  - Use a framework to implement the same site and compare
